<h2>The principal objective of this project is to gather information on weather condition in a room and  then 
analyze these information to solve the problems of dampness, which remains one of the key challenges facing houses or apartments 
in various parts of the world. 
<br> The project intends to develop an embedded system that helps to control the temperature in buildings. 
<br> An accurate prediction of the temperatures at which humidity and pressure are considered to be in a perfect equilibrium. 
<br> Since ventilation, room temperature, and humidity are the principal components of the environmental conditions in a room, 
an adequate control of these factors is expected to ensure that the issue of dampness is overcome by the buildings in which the 
system will be implemented...</p></h2>
